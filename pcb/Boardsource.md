# Boardsource Changes

For Boardsource to sell this as a kit I needed to make it work with the items Boardsource stocks. So here is a list of changes we made to this project

* Stacked FR4 case
* adjust hardware hole sizes to match what we offer.
* curved traces (just for funnzies)
* moved Pi Pico to a footprint with holes so that you can use clones.
